This project is based on the `Simple CRUD` template.

This template shows off a simple CRUD App, which allows you to create,
read, update, and delete menu items.

    existing items, and delete items. The data is stored in the `menu_items`
    state of the `CrudPage` component.
-   How to to create and use `custom dialogs`.

## Components
