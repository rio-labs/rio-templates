# Todo App

This is a placeholder README for your project. Use it to describe what your
project is about, to give new users a quick overview of what they can expect.

_Todo app_ was created using [Rio](https://rio.dev/), an easy to
use app & website framework for Python._

This project is based on the `Todo App` template.

## Todo App

This example shows off a simple Todo app which allows you to create tasks that
can later be marked as completed.

## Lessons

In this example you can see how to:

-   Persistently save data across sessions
-   Make components communicate via custom events

## Components

The example is composed of 3 main components:

1. `TodoItemComponent`: Displays the title and creation date of a todo item, and
   also comes with buttons that lets the user mark it as completed or delete it.
2. `NewTodoItemInput`: Allows the user to create a new todo item.
3. `TodoListPage`: Combines the 2 components above and adds all the logic
   necessary for saving/loading the todo list.
