# After creating our blog page that returns a `rio.PageView` and its
# corresponding sub-page directory, we can now set up a blog section to display
# the blog posts. Since `blog_page.py` has the `url_segment` "blog", we can
# designate the blog home page as the parent of the blog posts by setting its
# `url_segment` to an empty string. This makes the blog home page the parent
# page of all blog posts. Therefore, the url of the blog home page will be
# "website.com/blog". The blog posts will have urls like
# "website.com/blog/post1".
