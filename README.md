# Rio Templates üé®

Welcome to Rio's project templates. This repository contains all templates that
ship directly with Rio. Each directory contains a single template. You'll find
per-project README files in the individual directories as well.

[Live versions are available on the Rio website](https://rio.dev/examples) 

## Usage üéì

All of these already ship with Rio! You don't need to copy them from here. Just
set up your project with the `rio` command line tool. For example:

```sh
python -m rio new --template="tic-tac-toe"
```

(Depending on your platform, you might have to type `python3`, `py` or
completely drop the `python -m` part.)

## Contributing ü§ù

The source code for these lives in the actual [Rio
repository](https://github.com/rio-labs/rio). If you'd like to contribute a
change, or even new templates, please open a pull request there!

Templates are located in the snippets directory. For example, the tic-tac-toe
template lives
[here](https://github.com/rio-labs/rio/tree/main/rio/snippets/snippet-files/project-template-Tic-Tac-Toe).
